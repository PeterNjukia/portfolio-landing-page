                I've traveled every country
                I've traveled in my mind
                It seems we're on a journey
                A trip through space and time
                And somewhere lies the answer
                To all the questions why
                What really makes the difference
                Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive

                Like a roller in the ocean, life is motion
                Move on
                Like a wind that's always blowing, life is flowing
                Move on
                Like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning
                Move on
                How I treasure every minute, being part of, being in it
                With the urge to move on

            The morning breeze that ripples
            The surface of the sea
            The crying of the seagulls
            That hover over me
            I see it and I hear it
            But how can I explain
            The wonder of the moment
            To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain
